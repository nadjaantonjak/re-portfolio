reating a reactive portfolio page so its up to date for people to see when they visit. contributors- Nadja Antonjak

I was motivated to create a reactive portfolio my portfolio so its up to date and is able to potray the new work ive completed. showcasing my new work is important to me as it shows off my hard work and new skills im am able to bring with me to the working field when companies are looking at my work.

i updated my portfolio so people can acces my new work which potrays my skills and qualities, if they are intrested ive added a linked in page and maky more links making it easier for them to get in touch with me.

it solves the problem of searching different platforms to contact me. all my platforms are located with links on one page as well as having accces to my resume and social media making it easy to look at all my sites together.

throughout this task i learned how to make my profile reactive and design my portfolio better so its visually pleasing, i learned how to add links and make all the links work giving easy acccess to all my information.

I believe my portfolio stand out because of my layout. it has many different features and is very eye catching
